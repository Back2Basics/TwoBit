# 2-bit reader

This is a (work in progress) reader implementation, based on the
specs at UCSC, http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format7.

## TODO
- cleanup code
- add additional handling of I/O errors
- defer reading all meta-data for all sequences
- make "TwoBitSequence" more light-weight and get rid of the shared pointer
